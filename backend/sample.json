Surveys the entrenched modes of both conceptual and critical apprehension of the cultural forms and practices (from Negritude to postcolonialism and postmodernism), explores their methods of reading, raises the issue of their linkages to sources in Euro-America, and assesses the extent to which the unique concerns of the biography of culture in Africa (expressed by its creators and scholars) have tried to tame and refashion what are now globally shared critical tools of cultural reading.",

    "description": "Early recognition and aggressive management of shock states is one of the most challenging and rewarding patient care experiences. If done well the patient impact is incredible and lives can be saved. Integrate detailed physiologic understanding of shock states and shock evaluation - including echocardiography - with the pharmacology of shock management to develop a practical approach to patient care. Echocardiography training will emphasize obtaining views, recognizing anatomy and appreciating biventricular function as a method to differentiate shock states and select an appropriate treatment plan. The in-depth science of the course will be supplemented by clinical experiences focusing on shock evaluation and management in the cardiothoracic critical care unit, medical intensive care unit and, when possible, with cardiac anesthesiology enabling the student to develop a practical bedside approach to the evaluation and management of shock.",

In taking on this ongoing issue, we begin before living memory (to avoid the deadening effect of feedback loops within today's media world), with a focus on the visual and built environment. How do conspiracy theories work? Do they fall into patterns? How can we recognize them? If they are empowering, how should we think about that? Visual material plays a special role in the reinforcement of conspiracy theories. Case studies around the world, from the Egyptian pyramids to the birth of \"modern\" art in the twentieth century, center on ways in which an evidence-based account of the making of an artwork or architectural site has been replaced by a (usually more interesting) story about its true, hidden nature. This story usually purports to reveal the \"conspiracy\" of an empowered institution or group to keep the truth away from average people. Of course, the reality is often much simpler and the dynamics of power more complex.",
